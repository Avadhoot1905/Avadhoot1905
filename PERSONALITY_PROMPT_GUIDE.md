# Personality Prompt Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to customize the AI personality in your Messages app to respond as you.

## üìç File Location

The personality prompt is located at:
```
src/data/personality-prompt.ts
```

## üéØ What It Does

The personality prompt file defines how the Gemini AI will respond in the Messages app. It includes:
- Your professional identity and expertise
- Personality traits and communication style
- Areas of knowledge and interests
- Example phrases and response guidelines

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Customize

### 1. Open the Personality Prompt File
Navigate to `src/data/personality-prompt.ts` and edit the `PERSONALITY_PROMPT` constant.

### 2. Sections to Customize

#### Core Identity
Update with your actual information:
```typescript
- Name: Your Full Name
- Profession: Your Job Title
- Expertise: Your Key Skills
```

#### Personality Traits
Describe your actual personality:
- Are you formal or casual?
- Humorous or serious?
- Direct or diplomatic?
- Detail-oriented or big-picture focused?

#### Communication Style
How do you typically communicate?
- Sentence length and complexity
- Use of emojis or expressions
- Technical depth
- Tone (friendly, professional, etc.)

#### Areas of Expertise
List your actual skills and knowledge areas:
- Programming languages
- Frameworks and tools
- Industries or domains
- Hobbies and interests

#### Response Guidelines
Set boundaries for the AI:
- What topics should it discuss?
- How should it handle questions it can't answer?
- What level of detail to provide?

### 3. Example Customizations

**For a more casual tone:**
```typescript
## Communication Style
- Use casual language and slang
- Include emojis frequently üòä
- Keep responses short and punchy
- Use humor when appropriate
```

**For a more formal tone:**
```typescript
## Communication Style
- Use professional, formal language
- Minimize emoji usage
- Provide detailed, structured responses
- Maintain a respectful, business-like demeanor
```

**For a technical focus:**
```typescript
## Areas of Expertise
- Systems Architecture
- DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
- Microservices and API Design
- Performance Optimization
```

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

1. The prompt is imported in `src/actions/gemini.ts`
2. When a chat starts, the prompt is injected as the first "system" message
3. Gemini AI uses this context for all subsequent responses
4. The AI maintains this personality throughout the conversation

### Integration Points

**File: `src/actions/gemini.ts`**
```typescript
import { PERSONALITY_PROMPT } from "@/data/personality-prompt"

// The prompt is added to chat history
const systemMessage = {
  role: "user",
  parts: [{ text: PERSONALITY_PROMPT }],
}
```

**File: `src/components/apps/MessagesApp.tsx`**
- Uses `sendMessageWithHistory()` from gemini.ts
- Maintains conversation context
- Displays messages with timestamps

## üé® Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of "friendly," say "warm and welcoming, uses casual language, often checks in on how the user is doing"

### 2. Include Examples
Add example phrases you actually use:
```typescript
## Example Phrases You Might Use
- "Absolutely! Let me show you..."
- "That's a fantastic question"
- "Here's how I'd approach that..."
```

### 3. Set Boundaries
Be clear about what the AI should and shouldn't do:
```typescript
## What NOT to do
- Don't make up facts or experiences you don't have
- Don't give medical or legal advice
- Don't share confidential information
```

### 4. Add Context
Include background that helps the AI respond authentically:
```typescript
## Background
- Graduated from [University] with [Degree]
- Currently working at/on [Company/Project]
- Passionate about [Specific Interests]
- Based in [Location]
```

### 5. Test and Iterate
After making changes:
1. Save the file
2. Restart your development server if needed
3. Test the Messages app
4. Refine the prompt based on the responses

## üîÑ Updating the Prompt

Changes to the personality prompt take effect immediately in new conversations. Existing chat sessions maintain their context until the app is refreshed or restarted.

To test changes:
1. Edit `src/data/personality-prompt.ts`
2. Save the file
3. Refresh your browser
4. Start a new conversation in the Messages app

## üìù Example Complete Prompt

See the current `personality-prompt.ts` file for a complete example. It includes:
- All necessary sections
- Proper formatting
- Detailed guidelines
- Example phrases

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Adjusting AI Parameters

In `src/actions/gemini.ts`, you can also adjust:

```typescript
generationConfig: {
  maxOutputTokens: 1000,  // Response length (500-2000)
  temperature: 0.9,        // Creativity (0.1-1.0)
}
```

- **maxOutputTokens**: Controls response length (higher = longer responses)
- **temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity (higher = more creative/varied)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Issue: AI not responding with personality**
- Ensure the file is saved
- Check for syntax errors in the prompt
- Verify the import in `gemini.ts`
- Restart the dev server

**Issue: Responses are too generic**
- Add more specific details to your prompt
- Include more example phrases
- Increase temperature in generationConfig

**Issue: Responses are inconsistent**
- Make guidelines more explicit
- Add more examples
- Lower the temperature setting
