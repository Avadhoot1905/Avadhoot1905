# API Routes Cleanup

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Removed duplicate API routes from `/src/app/api/` directory since we've fully migrated to Next.js Server Actions.

## Why the Cleanup?

We had both API routes and server actions doing the same job:
- **API Routes (OLD):** `/src/app/api/github/route.ts`, `/src/app/api/leetcode/route.ts`, etc.
- **Server Actions (NEW):** `/src/actions/github.ts`, `/src/actions/leetcode.ts`, etc.

Server Actions are:
- ✅ More modern (Next.js 13+ recommended approach)
- ✅ Better type safety
- ✅ No need for HTTP requests between client and server
- ✅ Cleaner code organization
- ✅ Better performance

## What Was Removed

Deleted entire `/src/app/api/` directory containing:
- `/src/app/api/github/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/leetcode/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/medium/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/test-redis/route.ts`

## Current Architecture

Now using **only** Server Actions:
```
/src/actions/
  ├── github.ts       - GitHub data fetching
  ├── leetcode.ts     - LeetCode data fetching
  ├── medium.ts       - Medium data fetching
  └── test-redis.ts   - Redis testing utility
```

## Impact

✅ **No breaking changes** - SafariApp was already using server actions  
✅ **No code changes needed** - Everything works as before  
✅ **Cleaner codebase** - No duplicate functionality  
✅ **Better maintainability** - Single source of truth
