1. **Lock Screen**: iOS-style with phone wallpaper, thin fonts, swipe gesture
2. **Status Bar**: Compact header with time and status icons
3. **Notification Panel**: Pull-down shade with quick settings
4. **App Grid**: 4x3 grid centered on screen
5. **Dock**: 4 apps only (GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode, About Me)

## Technical Implementation

### Responsive Detection
- Used `window.innerWidth < 768` as mobile breakpoint
- Added resize event listeners for dynamic updates
- Used `useEffect` hooks to prevent hydration mismatches

### iOS Design Patterns
- Glassmorphic effects with backdrop blur
- Rounded corners (2xl on mobile)
- Sheet/modal presentations
- Spring animations
- Touch-optimized hit targets (minimum 44x44px)

### Gestures
- Touch event listeners for swipe detection
- Delta calculation for direction
- Threshold-based gesture recognition
- Non-blocking implementation (doesn't prevent other interactions)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Devices**:
   - Test on actual iOS devices (iPhone)
   - Test on Android devices
   - Test in Chrome DevTools mobile emulator
   - Test different screen sizes (iPhone SE, Pro Max, iPad)

2. **Interactions**:
   - Lock screen swipe/click
   - Notification panel pull-down
   - App icon taps
   - Window/modal opening and closing
   - Dock app launches
   - 2048 game swipe gestures
   - Theme switching

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Orientation changes
   - Safe area insets (notched devices)
   - Touch and mouse hybrid devices
   - Slow network (loading states)

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Safari (iOS)
- ✅ Chrome (Android)
- ✅ Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ⚠️ May need testing on older iOS versions

## Performance Considerations

- All mobile checks cached in state to avoid repeated calculations
- Event listeners properly cleaned up
- Animations use CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Backdrop blur effects optimized for mobile

## Future Enhancements

1. Add haptic feedback for iOS devices
2. Add app launch animations (spring from icon)
3. Add app switcher (iOS multitasking style)
4. Add search/Spotlight on mobile
5. Add widgets to notification panel
6. Add more swipe gestures (e.g., swipe between apps)
7. Add home indicator bar for iOS
8. Add Control Center (swipe from top-right)

## Conclusion

The portfolio now provides a seamless iOS-like experience on mobile devices while maintaining the original macOS desktop experience. All changes are responsive, performant, and follow iOS design guidelines.
