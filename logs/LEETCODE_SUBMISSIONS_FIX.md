# Fixed: LeetCode Recent Submissions Not Showing

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Updated LeetCode API Call**
   - Changed endpoint from `/acSubmission` to `/submission`
   - Added fallback to alternative API
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Increased limit to 10 submissions (filter to 5 accepted)

### 2. **Removed Double Filtering**
   - Server action already filters for "Accepted"
   - Removed redundant filter in SafariApp
   - Better data mapping with fallbacks

### 3. **Added Comprehensive Logging**
   - Console logs show submission data
   - Easier to debug if issues persist
   - Shows when no submissions found

### 4. **Added Fallback UI**
   - Shows message when no submissions available
   - Section always visible (not hidden)
   - Better user experience

## How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Cache
Since we changed the LeetCode fetching logic, you need to clear the Redis cache:

**Option A: Clear via Upstash Console**
1. Go to https://console.upstash.com/redis
2. Click your database
3. Go to "Data Browser"
4. Delete key: `leetcode-profile`

**Option B: Wait for Cache to Expire**
- LeetCode cache TTL is 30 minutes
- Wait 30 minutes and refresh

**Option C: Change the Cache Key (Quick Fix)**
Temporarily update `/src/actions/leetcode.ts`:
```typescript
const data = await getCachedData(
  'leetcode-profile-v2',  // Changed key name
  CACHE_TTL,
  // ...
)
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test in Browser
1. Open your portfolio
2. Go to Safari app
3. Click LeetCode tab
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Look for these logs:

```javascript
Fetching LeetCode data...
Fetching submissions from alfa-leetcode-api...
Submissions response: {...}
Found X recent accepted submissions
Recent problems data: [...]
Setting submissions: [...]
LeetCode result: {success: true, data: {...}}
```

### Step 4: Check Terminal
Should see:
```bash
Fetching fresh LeetCode data
Fetching submissions from alfa-leetcode-api...
Submissions response: ...
Found 5 recent accepted submissions
```

## Expected Results

### If Submissions Exist:
- "Recently Solved Problems" section shows
- List of 1-5 recent problems
- Each with title, status, language, date
- Clickable links to LeetCode problems

### If No Submissions:
- "Recently Solved Problems" section shows
- Gray box with message:
  "No recent submissions found. Check back later or view full profile on LeetCode."

### If API Fails:
- Stats still show (total solved, easy, medium, hard)
- No "Recently Solved Problems" section OR
- Message showing no submissions found

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still No Submissions Showing

**Check Console Logs:**
```javascript
// Should see:
Recent problems data: [...]  // Array with problems

// If you see:
Recent problems data: []  // Empty array
// or
Recent problems data: undefined
// Then the API isn't returning data
```

**Check if API is accessible:**
Open these URLs in your browser:
1. https://alfa-leetcode-api.onrender.com/arcsmo19/submission?limit=10
2. https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/arcsmo19

If these show data, the server action should work.

### Issue: API Returns Data But Not Showing

**Check the data structure:**
In browser console:
```javascript
import { getLeetcodeData } from '@/actions/leetcode'
getLeetcodeData().then(result => {
  console.log('Full result:', result)
  console.log('Recent problems:', result.data?.recentProblems)
})
```

### Issue: "Accepted" Submissions Not Filtered

The server action now filters for accepted submissions. Check terminal logs:
```
Found X recent accepted submissions
```

If X is 0, you might not have recent accepted submissions in the API response.

## API Endpoints Used

### Primary: Alfa LeetCode API
```
https://alfa-leetcode-api.onrender.com/arcsmo19/submission?limit=10
```
Returns all submissions (accepted + not accepted)

### Fallback: LeetCode Stats API
```
https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/arcsmo19/submission
```
Alternative if primary fails

## Data Structure

### Expected from API:
```javascript
{
  submission: [
    {
      title: "Two Sum",
      titleSlug: "two-sum",
      timestamp: "1697284800",
      statusDisplay: "Accepted",
      lang: "Python3"
    },
    // ... more submissions
  ]
}
```

### What's Stored:
```javascript
recentProblems: [
  {
    title: "Two Sum",
    titleSlug: "two-sum",
    timestamp: "1697284800",
    statusDisplay: "Accepted",
    lang: "Python3"
  },
  // ... up to 5 accepted submissions
]
```

## Changes Made

### File: `/src/actions/leetcode.ts`
- ✅ Changed API endpoint
- ✅ Added better logging
- ✅ Added fallback API
- ✅ Filter for accepted submissions server-side
- ✅ Better error handling

### File: `/src/components/apps/SafariApp.tsx`
- ✅ Added logging for debug
- ✅ Removed double filter
- ✅ Added fallback UI for no submissions
- ✅ Section always visible
- ✅ Better data mapping with defaults

## Quick Test Command

Add this to `/src/app/test/page.tsx` or run in console:

```javascript
import { getLeetcodeData } from '@/actions/leetcode'

getLeetcodeData().then(result => {
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('✅ LeetCode API working')
    console.log('Stats:', result.data.stats)
    console.log('Recent problems count:', result.data.recentProblems?.length || 0)
    console.log('Recent problems:', result.data.recentProblems)
  } else {
    console.log('❌ LeetCode API failed:', result.error)
  }
})
```

## Success Indicators

✅ Console shows "Found X recent accepted submissions"  
✅ Browser shows submission data  
✅ Recent problems section visible  
✅ Can click problems to go to LeetCode  
✅ Dates and languages showing correctly  

If you still don't see submissions after clearing cache and restarting:
1. Check if the APIs are accessible (open URLs in browser)
2. Check browser console for the exact data structure
3. Share the console logs for further debugging
