# Projects Multi-Domain Support Update

## Overview
Enhanced the projects system to support multiple domain categories for individual projects, specifically adding Machine Learning category to iVision and Study.ai projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Project Interface** (`src/data/projects.ts`)
- Added optional `domains` array field to Project interface
- Allows projects to belong to multiple categories
- Maintains backward compatibility with single `domain` field

```typescript
export interface Project {
  // ...existing fields
  domain: "Website Development" | "App Development" | "system" | "Extension Development" | "Data Science" | "Machine Learning" | ""
  domains?: ("Website Development" | "App Development" | "system" | "Extension Development" | "Data Science" | "Machine Learning")[]
  // ...other fields
}
```

### 2. **Updated Specific Projects**

#### iVision
- **Primary Domain**: App Development
- **Additional Domain**: Machine Learning
- Uses ML models (TensorFlow, CoreML, Torch-Vision) for eye disease detection

#### Study.ai
- **Primary Domain**: Website Development
- **Additional Domain**: Machine Learning
- Uses Gemini API for AI-powered personalized learning paths

### 3. **Enhanced ProjectsApp Component** (`src/components/apps/ProjectsApp.tsx`)

#### Updated Filtering Logic
- Now checks both `domain` and `domains` array when filtering
- Projects with multiple domains appear in all relevant category filters
- Example: iVision shows in both "üì± App" and "ü§ñ ML" filters

```typescript
const filteredProjects = filter === "all" 
  ? projects 
  : projects.filter(p => {
      if (p.domains && p.domains.length > 0) {
        return p.domains.includes(filter as any)
      }
      return p.domain === filter
    })
```

#### Visual Domain Indicators
- Projects with multiple domains now show domain badges
- Small icon badges appear next to project title
- Each badge uses the domain's color scheme for easy identification

## How It Works

1. **Single Domain Projects**: Continue to work as before using the `domain` field
2. **Multi-Domain Projects**: Use the `domains` array to specify all categories
3. **Filtering**: When a category filter is selected, projects appear if:
   - Their `domain` matches, OR
   - Their `domains` array includes the filter category
4. **Display**: Multi-domain projects show small badge indicators for each category

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Accurate Categorization**: Projects can now be properly categorized in multiple domains  
‚úÖ **Better Discoverability**: Users can find ML projects whether browsing App, Web, or ML categories  
‚úÖ **Visual Clarity**: Badge indicators show all applicable categories at a glance  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Existing projects without `domains` array continue to work  
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Easy to add more domains to any project in the future

## Examples of Multi-Domain Projects

### iVision
- Appears in: **App Development** ‚úì **Machine Learning** ‚úì
- Why: iOS app using ML for disease detection

### Study.ai
- Appears in: **Website Development** ‚úì **Machine Learning** ‚úì
- Why: Web app using AI/ML for personalized learning

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add ML domain to other AI-powered projects
- Create a "Featured Multi-Domain" section
- Add domain combination statistics
- Allow filtering by multiple domains simultaneously
- Add domain-specific project metrics

## Testing

To test the changes:
1. Open the Projects app
2. Click on "ü§ñ ML" filter
3. Verify that both iVision and Study.ai appear
4. Click on "üì± App" - iVision should still appear
5. Click on "üåê Web" - Study.ai should still appear
6. Check that domain badges show correctly on multi-domain projects
