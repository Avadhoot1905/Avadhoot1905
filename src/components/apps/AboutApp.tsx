          I am a hardworking and persevering individual who believes in continuous improvement. 
          Patience and resilience drive my approach to problem-solving, and I am always eager to 
          refine my skills, adapt to new challenges, and push my boundaries.

          Passionate about competitive programming, I actively solve LeetCode and DSA problems to 
          enhance my algorithmic thinking. My goal is to be able to reach a level of enlightenment 
          where coding becomes second natureâ€”where I only need to think about the algorithm, and the 
          code flows effortlessly without conscious effort. Alongside this, I build full-stack 
          applications using industry-standard technologies like Next.js, Prisma, Docker, Git, etc., 
          ensuring scalability and efficiency in my projects. My aim is to bridge the gap between 
          theoretical knowledge and real-world application, creating solutions that are both impactful 
          and innovative.

        <p className={theme === "dark" ? "text-gray-300" : "text-gray-700"}>
          My journey is one of continuous learning, building, and problem-solving, and I look forward 
          to embracing new challenges and opportunities that help me grow.
