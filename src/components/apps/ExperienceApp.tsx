            Being a part of ACM-VIT has been one of the most transformative experiences of my college journey. 
            This vibrant and dynamic club has not only sharpened my technical expertise but also shaped my 
            management and organizational skills, offering me a platform to grow beyond just coding.

              Through ACM-VIT, I deepened my understanding of web development, working on impactful projects 
              like ExamCooker, where I learned how to build scalable, efficient web applications. The hands-on 
              exposure to Git, GitHub, Docker, and modern development practices strengthened my ability to 
              collaborate on real-world projects. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in 
              frontend and backend technologies, preparing me for industry-level development.

              Beyond coding, ACM-VIT introduced me to event organization and management, where I played a role 
              in planning and executing technical events, hackathons, and workshops. Handling logistics, 
              coordinating teams, and ensuring smooth execution taught me the value of teamwork, leadership, 
              and problem-solving in high-pressure situations.

              chapter in college, this community fosters collaboration, mentorship, and innovation, making it
